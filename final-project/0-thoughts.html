                <p class="western">Write <strong>1 page</strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> about your final project. If you're having a hard time getting started, consider covering any or all of these topics:</span></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p class="western" style="font-weight: normal;">A project you would like to work on as your final project.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="western" style="font-weight: normal;">Work you have done in the past that you are excited about and that might be a good candidate to publish on the web as an interactive map.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="western" style="font-weight: normal;">Projects that others have done that you might like to emulate.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="western" style="font-weight: normal;">Thoughts about webmaps&mdash;what inspires you about them?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="western" style="font-weight: normal;">Map-related skills that you would like to acquire, in this course or at a later date.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="western"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Th</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">ere</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> is no right or wrong for this assignment as long as the writing is long enough and is submitted on time. I will take these responses into account while writing future assignments. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Your response</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> is the beginning of a discussion about your final project.</span></p>
                <p class="western"><span style="font-weight: normal;">In class on Wednesday (February 5) we will casually go around the room and hear people's early ideas, so please be prepared to do so.</span></p>
